As modern processors include multiple levels of hierarchy and as the cache associativity increases, the importance
of selecting the optimal cache replacement policy also rises. Different cache replacement policies
evict differently based on the data itemsâ€™ recency, reference rate, frequency and size. In this project, we
have implemented three cache replacement policies from academic publications and compared them against
the common policies already implemented inside gem5. Our results demonstrate that the performance of a
policy depends strongly on the application, complexity, and cache configurations.
